	<h3 style="color: lightpink;">Background</h3>
	<p style="color:lightpink; width: 1000px;">Megumi is the girl in the one-piece summer dress and white beret that Tomoya Aki had a "fateful encounter" with. Although Tomoya initially praises Megumi's beauty and professes his love for her, he is briefly disappointed after they were properly introduced and vows to raise her into his ideal heroine. She is the model for Meguri, one of the main heroines of Blessing Software's "cherry blessing".</p>
	<h3 style="color: lightpink; text-align: right;">Personality</h3>
	<p style="color:lightpink; text-align: right; margin-left: 50%">Megumi is portrayed as an ordinary girl with no distinctive character and she is extremely normal where she is so plain that Tomoya Aki failed to realize that he was actually classmates with her. She is described as stealthy due to her lack of presence, and the others often forget that she is even in the same room.
<br>
However, Megumi is a kind and soft-spoken girl that wants the best for others and she constantly goes out of her way for Tomoya and the others to help in any way that she can. She knows little about otaku culture but never keeps Tomoya at arm's length and gives into his approaches from the start. She has strong ideas regarding friendship and feels easily slighted when they are violated.

Her attitude towards Tomoya is often described as furatto and he is often the unfortunate target of snide, deadpan retorts from her. Despite this, her close relationship with Tomoya and the others brings out more of her than he first believes she is capable of showing. Her emotionless expressions often cause Eriri trouble illustrating her, so Eriri takes every opportunity to catch different sides of her personality for the game's art.

Later in the series her emotions becomes more visible, especially when it comes to matters involving members of Blessing Software and Tomoya. When she was appointed leader of Blessing Software after Eriri and Utaha left, it was noted by Iori that she has a passive-aggressive personality.</p>
